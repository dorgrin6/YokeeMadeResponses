# YokeeMadeResponses
My collection of automations responses and clipboard usage.

This automation of responses consists of 2 ideas: (one click to copy response)

1. YokeeReply JS.
    JavaScript implementation: both gmail and GooglePlay responses.
    gmail: pure JS.
    GooglePlay my try with [clipboardjs](https://clipboardjs.com/).

2. Ruby implementaion: made responses as GUI.
    You need [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) to run res.rb.

Enjoy!
