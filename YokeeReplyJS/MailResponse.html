  <H3>Trying to share youtube</H3>

    Hi,
    <br> I assume you are trying to open a YouTube video you have recorded.
    <br>
    <br> Unfortunately youtube videos can be opened only if the receiving user have the app due to licensing restrictions.
    <br>
    <br> In case you'll record a non-YouTube video (mostly English songs in our playlists), you will be able to open the shared link outside the app.
