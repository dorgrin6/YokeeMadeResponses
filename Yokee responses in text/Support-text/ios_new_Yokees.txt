The Yokees (coins) are used in order to record songs.
You need a certain amount to record.

This amount will be written at the bottom of the page after recording and you'll have options to earn more Yokees.

If you subscribe to an ALL ACCESS PASS you can record as much as you'd like and any song you'd like.
