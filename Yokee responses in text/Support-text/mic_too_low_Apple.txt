Hi,

Please try the following:
1. Go to the settings in  your device, find Yokee and check that you've allowed the app to use the microphone.

2.Insert headphones/earphones to your device, and while recording press the speaker icon and make sure it's all the way to the right.

Please email us if that hasn't helped.
