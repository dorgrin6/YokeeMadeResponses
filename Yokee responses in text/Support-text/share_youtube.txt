Hi, 
I assume you are trying to open a YouTube video you have recorded. 

Unfortunately youtube videos can be opened only if the receiving user have the app due to licensing restrictions. 

In case you'll record a non-YouTube video (mostly English songs in our playlists), you will be able to open the shared link outside the app. 

Sorry for the inconvenience.
